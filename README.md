# career-net
Team CareerNets project written using Express JS and React.

Team CareerNet is creating a web application dashboard to track the career growth of NAU students and alumini. Our goal is to build a tool that can be used by Deans, chairmen, faculty, students, and potential lumberjacks to explore how degree programs pan out for students that attend our school.
